# Imaginary Cube

A 3D visualizer of various imaginary cubes

## :bulb: Inspiration

- I recently came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnhr6VaQKlg) by Ben Gobler that provides a very succinct yet entertaining introduction into the world of imaginary cubes. It talks about [Hideki Tsuiki](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsmJvExpzRQdoPFlOXGRDHg)'s work on imaginary cubes and how one could generate your own imaginary cube fractals.
- This got me thinking: what if I could visualize this without having to 3D print it?
- This idea, coupled with my recent interest in three.js, got me reading [more](https://www.i.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp/users/tsuiki/imaginarycube-e.html) on the subject, figuring out what shapes work and how they could be rotated to work, until eventually deciding to make my own visualizer for the same.
